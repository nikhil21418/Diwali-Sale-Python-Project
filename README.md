Diwali Sales Data Analysis 🪔📊

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Diwali Sales dataset to uncover key trends and customer behaviors. The primary goal is to clean the raw data, analyze sales patterns, and visualize the results to help improve business decision-making during the festive season.

Project Overview
Dataset: Diwali Sales Data (CSV)

Objective: Analyze customer demographics, product categories, and sales amounts to identify high-potential customer segments and popular products.

Tools Used:

Python: Core programming language.

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating data visualizations (bar charts, count plots, etc.).

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Key Steps
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values (e.g., dropping rows with critical missing info).

Fixed data types (e.g., converting 'Amount' to integer).

Removed unrelated/blank columns (e.g., 'Status', 'unnamed1').

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Gender Analysis: Compared purchasing power and frequency between male and female customers.

Age Group Analysis: Identified which age brackets contribute the most to sales.

State-wise Sales: Determined the top states with the highest order volumes and total sales amounts.

Marital Status: Analyzed spending habits based on marital status.

Occupation & Product Category: Explored sales distribution across different occupations and product categories.

Key Findings (Example)
Sample Insight: Female customers in the age group of 26-35 years contributed the most to the total sales.

Sample Insight: The 'Food', 'Clothing', and 'Electronics' categories were the top-performing product segments.
